Conclusion:

In conclusion, this project successfully demonstrates how data visualization can be leveraged to gain insights and communicate findings in a clear and impactful way. 
Using Matplotlib and Seaborn for static plots, and Folium for interactive geographical visualizations, we explored various techniques to represent data visually.
By enhancing the core examples from IBMâ€™s course with additional customizations and analysis, we provided a more thorough understanding of how these tools can be utilized in practice. 
This project serves as a solid foundation for further exploration into data visualization and analysis using Python.
